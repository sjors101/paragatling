# Paragatling
To run Gatling parallel with multiple hosts

#Notes:
 - Change User and the Gatling details to your need.
 - The host variable must contain your "other" gatling IP/DNS address. It is possible to define multiple hosts, which must be seperated with a space.
 - Make sure the ssh-rsa (/home/user/paragatling.pem) is copyed to the other hosts /home/ssh/user
